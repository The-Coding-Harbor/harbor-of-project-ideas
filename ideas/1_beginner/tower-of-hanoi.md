# Tower of Hanoi ðŸ—¼

**Level:** Beginner

**Description:**
Create an interactive Tower of Hanoi puzzle game where users can move disks between three rods, following the game's classic rules. Visualize each move and validate user actions.

**Problem Context:**  
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle invented in 1883.  
The objective is to move an entire stack of disks from the first rod to the third rod, obeying three rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the top disk from one rod and placing it onto another rod.
- No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

**Stretch Goals (Optional):**
- Add an automatic solver that shows the optimal moves.
- Add difficulty levels (number of disks).
- Implement a timer and move counter to challenge players.
- Build a beautiful animated version with smooth disk movement.
- Build a leaderboard for fastest solving times.
- Add sound effects when moving disks.
