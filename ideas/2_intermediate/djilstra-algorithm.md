# Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm Visualizer üõ∞Ô∏è

**Level:** Intermediate

**Description:**  
Build an interactive visualizer for Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm ‚Äî one of the most well-known shortest path algorithms used in graphs. Allow users to place nodes and edges, then watch the algorithm explore and compute the shortest path.

**Problem Context:**  
Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It‚Äôs used in GPS navigation, network routing, and game AI. This project helps developers understand how the algorithm works through live visualization.

**Stretch Goals (Optional):**
- Add step-by-step animation of how the algorithm processes each node.
- Support other algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS) and allow user to switch between them.
- Allow real-time weight editing and obstacle placement.
- Add keyboard shortcuts or touch controls.
- Create a dark mode for the visualizer.
